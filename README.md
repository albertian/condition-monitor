This is a web service which provide fetching data and presenting data about abstract components during the time.

It's just MVP especially in UI side, so it's ok thet some styles look a bit odd.

The main purpose is to provide example of my code style so not all choosen approaches are extremely effective: e.x. it's not best idea to use redux in small project with such minimalistic structure of store, and for UI graphic part it's more easy to use graphic-oriented libraries like D3 instead of manual manipulating with DOM and styles.
